Live Session Unit 03 Assignment

##1.	 GitHub Cloning (20 points): Using Git, clone the following GitHub repository to your local machine: https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets.  In RMarkdown, please show the code (commented out, as itâ€™s not R syntax) that you used to create a new directory, navigate to the appropriate directory, and clone the repository to it.  One Git command per line, please.

#Commenting out the following code because it has already run. 

```r
#Making sure that my working directory is set correctly to my github syncronized directory
#setwd("/Users/mmastran/SMU/MSDS/github/MSDS/unit03")
#Creating variable to store URL of awesome-public-datasets
#UrlAddress <- "https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets"
#Git Command to clone awesome-public-datasets to my MSDS/unit03 Github repository
#git2r::clone(url = UrlAddress, local_path = "/Users/mmastran/SMU/MSDS/github/MSDS/unit03/awesome-public-datasets")
```

##2.	Data Summary (20 points): 
#From this aforementioned cloned repo, please extract titanic.csv.zip.  To be clear, this does not have to be done in Git or command line.  
*a.	In R, please read in titanic.csv via either read.table() or read.csv(), assigning it to df.  This dataset follows the passengers aboard the Titanic, including their fees paid, rooms rented, and survivorship status.
*b.	Output the respective count of females and males aboard the Titanic. Plot the frequency of females and males.  Be sure to give an accurate title and label the axes.
*c.	Please use one apply function (to review: swirl() modules 11, 12) to output the means of Age, Fare, and Survival.  Make sure the output is a real number for all three means.


```r
#Creating variable to store path of the cloned awesome-public-datasets repo. I am sure there is a fancier way to code navigation from the cloned directory root to the sub directory that contains the titanic.csv.zip file. Would be great to improve this in that way. 
awesome_public_data_archive <- "/Users/mmastran/SMU/MSDS/github/MSDS/unit03/awesome-public-datasets/Datasets/titanic.csv.zip"
#extract titanic.csv from archive
unzip(awesome_public_data_archive)
```
##2a. In R, please read in titanic.csv via either read.table() or read.csv(), assigning it to df.  This dataset follows the passengers aboard the Titanic, including their fees paid, rooms rented, and survivorship status.

```r
##Read in titanic.csv using readcsv() and store in a data frame name 'titanic_data' then pass to the str() function for analysis of structure

#Store titanic.csv path in variable
titanic_csv_path <- "/Users/mmastran/SMU/MSDS/github/MSDS/unit03/titanic.csv"

#read in data from titanic.csv
titanic_data <- read.csv(titanic_csv_path)

#Confirm class of titanic_data and analyze Structure using str() function to identify column names 'variables', variance and number of observations.
str(titanic_data)
```

```

4.	Function Building (30 points): You research sleep and just got your first data set.  Later, youâ€™ll have another dataset with the same column names, so you want to create a helper function that you can analyze this dataset and the next.  Load sleep_data_01.csv (found at http://talklab.psy.gla.ac.uk/L1_labs/lab_1/homework/index.html).  Questions 3A through 3D should be answered in function(x){}.  3E can be outside of the function. 
*a.	Create objects for the median Age, the minimum and maximum Duration of sleep, and the mean and standard deviation of the Rosenberg Self Esteem scale (RSES).  You may need to specify a few options like in Problem 2 and live session.
*b.	Create a data.frame object called report: it should consist of the median age, the RSES mean and standard deviation respectively divided by five (since there are five questions and these scores are summed), and the range of Duration (the statistical definition of range; it should be a single number.)
*c.	Change the column names of this data.frame to MedianAge, SelfEsteem, SE_SD, and DurationRange.
*d.	Round the report to at most 2 digits: leave this as the closing line to the function.
*e.	Finally, run the function on your sleep data to show the output.


```r
#Download the file sleep_data_01.csv from http://talklab.psy.gla.ac.uk/L1_labs/lab_1/homework/index.html and store in a dataframe 'sleep_data

# Download and store data from sleep_data_01.csv and store in a dataframe 'sleep_data'

##4a.	Create objects for the median Age, the minimum and maximum Duration of sleep, and the mean and standard deviation of the Rosenberg Self Esteem scale (RSES).  You may need to specify a few options like in Problem 2 and live session.

#and the range of Duration (the statistical definition of range; it should be a single number.)

##4c.	Change the column names of this data.frame to MedianAge, SelfEsteem, SE_SD, and DurationRange.

5.	FiveThirtyEight Data (30 points): Navigate on GitHub to https://github.com/rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight and read README.md. It will include everything you need. 
*a.	Install the fivethirtyeight package.
*b.	In the listing of Data sets in package â€˜fivethirtyeight,â€™ assign the 22nd data set to an object â€˜df.â€™
*c.	Use a more detailed list of the data sets to write out the URL in a comment to the related news story.
*d.	Using R command(s), give the dimensions and column names of this data frame.
##
## 5a.	Install the fivethirtyeight package.

```r
#Making sure that my working directory is set correctly to my github syncronized directory
#setwd("/Users/mmastran/SMU/MSDS/github/MSDS/unit03")
#Creating variable to store URL of FiveThirtyEight
#UrlAddress <- "https://github.com/rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight"
#list(UrlAddress)
#Git Command to clone FiveThirtyEight to my MSDS/unit03/FiveThirtyEight Github repository
#git2r::clone(url = UrlAddress, local_path = "/Users/mmastran/SMU/MSDS/github/MSDS/unit03/FiveThirtyEight")
#install.packages("fivethirtyeight")
#library(fivethirtyeight)
```

#*b.	In the listing of Data sets in package â€˜fivethirtyeight,â€™ assign the 22nd data set to an object â€˜df.â€™

6.	Data Summary (30 points): Use your newly assigned data frame from question 4 for this question. 
*a.	Write an R command that gives you the column names of the data frame.  Right after that, write one that counts the number of columns but not rows.  Hint: The number should match one of your numbers in Question 1d for dimensions.
*b.	Generate a count of each unique major_category in the data frame.  I recommend using libraries to help.  To be clear, this should look like a matrix or data frame containing the major_category and the frequency it occurs in the dataset.  Assign it to major_count.
*c.	To make things easier to read, put par(las=2) before your plot to make the text perpendicular to the axis.  Make a barplot of major_count.  Make sure to label the title with something informative (check the vignette if you need), label the x and y axis, and make it any color other than grey.  Assign the major_category labels to their respective bar.  Flip the barplot horizontally so that bars extend to the right, not upward.  All of these options can be done in a single pass of barplot(). Note: Itâ€™s okay if itâ€™s wider than the preview pane.
*d.	Write the fivethirtyeight data to a csv file.  Make sure that it does not have row labels.


7.	Codebook (30 points): 
*a.	Start a new repository on GitHub for your SMU MSDS homework.  On your local device, make sure there is a directory for Homework at the minimum; you are welcome to add whatever you would like to this repo in addition to your requirements here.
*b.	Create a README.md file which explains the purpose of the repository, the topics included, the sources for the material you post, and contact information in case of questions. Remember, the one in the root directory should be general.  You are welcome to make short READMEs for each assignment individually in other folders.
*c.	In one (or more) of the nested directories, post your RMarkdown script, HTML file, and data from â€˜fivethirtyeight.â€™  Make sure that in your README or elsewhere that you credit fivethirtyeight in some way.
*d.	In your RMarkdown script, please provide the link to this GitHub so the grader can see it.
