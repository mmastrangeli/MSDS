## Parsing data from .csv into dataframes 'Beers' and 'Breweries'
```{r , echo=TRUE}
library(readr)
Beers <- read_csv("Beers.csv")
View(Beers)
Breweries <- read_csv("Breweries.csv")
View(Breweries)
```

##Questions
*1.	How many breweries are present in each state?
```{r, echo=FALSE}
table(Breweries$State)



```
2.	Merge beer data with the breweries data. Print the first 6 observations and the last six observations to check the merged file.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
Breweries.Beers <- merge(Beers, Breweries, by.x = ("Brewery_id"), by.y = ("Brew_ID"), sort = TRUE)
View(Breweries.Beers)
head(Breweries.Beers, 6)
tail(Breweries.Beers, 6)
```

3.	Report the number of NA's in each column.
```{r , echo=TRUE}
# Number of NA's per Column
colSums(is.na(Breweries.Beers))

```

4.	Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. Plot a bar chart to compare.
```{r , echo=TRUE}


State_ABV_Median <- tapply(Breweries.Beers$ABV, Breweries.Beers$State, median, na.rm = TRUE)
State_ABV_Median


State_IBU_Median <- tapply(Breweries.Beers$IBU, Breweries.Beers$State, median, na.rm = TRUE)
State_IBU_Median
```
5.	Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?
```{r , echo=TRUE}

MaxABV <- max(Breweries.Beers$ABV, na.rm = TRUE)
MaxABV
MaxIBU <- max(Breweries.Beers$IBU, na.rm = TRUE)
MaxIBU

#Display the Row from the Breweries.Beers data frame for which Breweries.Beers$ABV = MaxABV

#Display the Row from the Breweries.Beers data frame for which Breweries.Beers$IBU = MaxIBU

#Display the State with MaxABV

#Display the State with MaxIBU

```


6.	Summary statistics for the ABV variable.
```{r , echo=TRUE}
summary()
```


7.	Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? Draw a scatter plot.
```{r , echo=TRUE}
ABV_State <- tapply(Breweries.Beers$ABV, Breweries.Beers$State, median, na.rm = TRUE)
ABV_State
IBU_State <- tapply(Breweries.Beers$IBU, Breweries.Beers$State, median, na.rm = TRUE)
IBU_State
```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
